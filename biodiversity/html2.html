<h2>Mango Tree</h2>
<img src="mango.jpg" width="200" height="200"><p>
Mango trees are deep-rooted, symmetrical evergreens that attain heights of 90 feet and widths of 80 feet.<br> Mango trees have simple alternate lanceolate leaves that are 12 to 16 inches in length and yellow-green, purple, or copper in color when young.<br> Mature leaves are leathery, glossy, and deep green in color. They also originate from Southeast Asia.
<p>
<h2>Lily</h2>
<img src="lily.jpg" width="200"><p>
Lilies typically feature 6 tepal flowers in a variety of shapes (trumpet, funnel, cup, bell, bowl or flat), sometimes nodding,<br> sometimes with reflexed petals, atop stiff, unbranched stems (1-8 feet tall) clothed with linear to elliptic leaves. Flowers are often fragrant and come<br> in a broad range of colors except blue. They also originate from Central and East Asian.
<p>
<h2>Cactus</h2>
<img src="cactus.jpg" width="200"><p>
Cacti are plants that have succulent stems, pads or branches with scales and spines instead of leaves. Cactus pads are<br> actually modified stems with a waxy coating. The prickly spines are modified leaves that break up<br> winds that blow across pad surfaces, and help shade the stem. They also originate from America.
<p>
<h2>Bamboo</h2>
<img src="bamboo.jpg" width="250"><p>
Bamboo is a complex, woody stemmed perennial grass belonging to family Poaceae. The portion of bamboo below the<br> ground level is called rhizome, which forms the vital source for its perennial growth. Roots are produced by the rhizome and<br> also extend up to the lower nodes of the stems that are below the soil. They also originate from China.
<p>
<h2>Dandelion</h2>
<img src="dandelion.jpg" width="200"><p>
Dandelion is a hardy perennial that can grow to a height of nearly 12 inches. The plants have deeply-notched, toothy, spatula-like<br> leaves that are shiny and hairless. Dandelion stems are capped by bright yellow flowers. The grooved<br> leaves funnel rain to the root. They also originate from Eurasia or Europe and Asia.
<p>
<h2>Spider</h2>
<img src="spider.jpg" width="200"><p>
Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight limbs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and<br> spinnerets that extrude silk. They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders<br> of organisms. Spiders are found all over the world, and they evolved over millions of years, so they don't have a specific origin country.
<p>
<h2>Wasp</h2>
<img src="wasp.jpg" width="200"><p>
Like all insects, wasps have three pairs of legs, antennae, and three body segments called the head, thorax and abdomen. Wasps<br> can be distinguished from bees by their pointed lower abdomen and a narrow waist called a petiole, between the abdomen and thorax. Wasp size varies among species.<br> Just like spiders, wasps also originate from all around the world. Wasps are found globally and evolved over time, so they donâ€™t originate from a single country.
<p>
<h2>Bird</h2>
<img src="bird.jpg" width="200"><p>
Birds are warm-blooded animals with feathers, beaks, and wings. They lay eggs and are found in many habitats around the world. While many<br> can fly, some, like ostriches and penguins, cannot. Birds play important roles in nature, such as pollinating plants and controlling pests.<br> Birds also evolved over millions of years and don't originate from a single country.
<p>
<h2>Dragonfly</h2>
<img src="dragonfly.jpg" width="200"><p>
Dragonfly species (Anisoptera) are characterized by long bodies with two narrow pairs of intricately veined, membranous wings that,<br> while generally transparent, may have coloured markings. Unlike damselflies, the front and rear wing pairs are shaped differently.<br> Dragonflies actually don't have a specific origin country since they evolved over millions of years and are now found globally.
<p>
<h2>Butterfly</h2>
<img src="butterfly.jpg" width="200"><p>
Butterflies have six jointed legs, a pair of antennae and three body parts called a head, thorax (chest), and abdomen (tail end). The four wings<br> and the six legs of a butterfly are attached to its thorax. Special sensors on a butterfly or moths' feet allow the insect to taste their food.<br> Butterflies don't actually have an origin country, but they did evolve around 50 to 100 million years ago, with their ancestors likely originating in tropical regions.<p>
